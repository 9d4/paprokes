**Sail User Notice**

This branch is very experimental, so we need to isolate from the main branch.
Don't worry, we have all set. Just run execute `sail up` to start the project.

Nevertheless, if you want to customize it just open the `docker-compose.yml`.
Keep in mind, _networks_ names and _volumes_ names cannot be the same with the
main branch.
